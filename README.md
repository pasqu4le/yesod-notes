# Yesod-notes
This is a Yesod experiment.

More info will be up as soon as this gets more interesting.

## Documentation

* Read the [Yesod Book](https://www.yesodweb.com/book) online for free
* Check [Stackage](http://stackage.org/) for documentation on the packages in your LTS Haskell version, or [search it using Hoogle](https://www.stackage.org/lts/hoogle?q=). Tip: Your LTS version is in your `stack.yaml` file.
* For local documentation, use:
	* `stack haddock --open` to generate Haddock documentation for your dependencies, and open that documentation in a browser
	* `stack hoogle <function, module or type signature>` to generate a Hoogle database and search for your query
* The [Yesod cookbook](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod-cookbook) has sample code for various needs
